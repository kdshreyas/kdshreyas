Hi there 👋 My name is Shreyas, I am practicing data analytics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering as well as former experience in the analytics field. Since Jan 2021, I have been dedicating efforts to learning and practicing skills for data analytics and visualization.📊

Since I was in engineering,⚙ I always found myself more involved in analytical subjects as well as the business side 🏢 of things kept me wondering how these things at a large scale were managed and analyzed to make clear decisions. after learning more about data analytics, it really spoke to me not only as something meaningful in itself but something I would be engaged to take part in.🙃

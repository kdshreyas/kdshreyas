Hi there 👋 My name is Shreyas, I am practicing data science Since 2020. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering as well as former experience in the analytics field. Since I was in engineering,⚙ I always found myself more involved in analytical subjects as well as the business side 🏢 of things kept me wondering how these things at a large scale were managed and analyzed to make clear business decisions. after learning more about data science, it really spoke to me not only as something meaningful in itself but something I would be engaged to take part in.🙃
